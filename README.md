The INGENIA-SE Autonomous Drone Racing Challenge 2022-2023

<div style="text-align: right"> 
The Challenge of this project is to organize an **Autonomous Drone Racing (ADR) competition** between two drones (each one managed by one team). The competition is based on several tests such as known and unkown-path obstacle races, a straight-line speed race, laser target-aiming or a follow-line race. This is done through Model-based System Engineering (MBSE).

This repository is structured in four main sections:
- **Requirements**: where the system specifications and their validation procedures are defined.
- **Documentation**: where all the different documentation files concerning the project and their respective versions are managed.
- **MATLAB System Composer Model**: where the system's model for its characterization from different perspectives is included.
- **Software**: where the all the different software packages which are necessary for the simulation are included.

The architecture is documented in MATLAB System Composer. </div>
