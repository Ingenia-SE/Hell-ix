# Hell-ix Project

This GitHub repository is home to the **Autonomous Drone Racing Challenge 2022-2023**, a project in progress by Hell-ix and Droning teams. In particular, this repository includes the work done by Hell-ix team. The aim of the project is to organize an Autonomous Drone Racing (ADR) competition between two drones (each one managed by one team). The competition is based on three main tests: a straight-line speed race through four gates, a race through four gates forming a semicircle, and a freestyle test. The objetive is to win the competition by performing the best as possible. [Click here](https://ingenia-se.github.io/Hell-ix/) to go there!

2. **Hell-ix_Project folder**: Contains the updated MATLAB System Composer project with our system model (including its requirements).
3. **Simulation folder**: Contains the files used to perform the simulations.
4. **Software folder**: Contains the source code developped for the ADR competition.
5. **docs**: Contains the necessary files for the project's github.io page.
6. **img**: Contains the necessary figures for the project's repository.

## How to submit an Engineering Change Request (ECR)?

After deciding an ECR for the change is needed, you may prepare its submission following these steps:

1. In GitHub, under the Issues tab, click “New Issue” and select the ECR template.
2. Fill out the form using Markdown styling language. The form itself has indications commented out for helping its redaction. Checking the preview may also be useful.
*(Note: ECR ID# format is two-digit year/number. For example, if it is the 4th report of the year 2023, the ID# is 23/04).*
3. Once it has been filled, make sure you are not missing any information and send it. You may be able to modify it after sending, but once it has been registered by a Configuration Control Board (CCB) authority, newer modifications might not be considered.
4. As soon as possible, a CCB authority will have registered the issue. Once that person receives the application, he will post a comment in the issue indicating time and date of the reception.
5. After that, when a decision has been made (either approved or rejected), it will be notified to the requestor by commenting the issue on GitHub and closing it.
