# Hell-ix Project

This GitHub repository is home to Hell-ix, an INGENIA-SE team participating in the Autonomous Drone Racing Challenge 2022-2023. The aim of the project is to organize an **Autonomous Drone Racing (ADR) competition** between two drones (each one managed by one team). The competition is based on three main tests: a straight-line speed race through four gates, a race through four gates forming a semicircle, and a freestyle test. The objetive is to win the competition by performing the best as possible.
